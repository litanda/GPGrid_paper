% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Grid-based modelling is widely used for estimating stellar parameters. However, stellar model grid is sparse because of the computational cost. This paper demonstrates an application of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression that turns a sparse model grid to a continuous function. We train GP models to map five fundamental inputs (mass, equivalent evolutionary phase, initial metallicity, initial helium fraction, and the mixing-length parameter) to observable outputs (effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, surface metallicity, and stellar age). 
%
We preliminarily test different approaches with a small subset of data and set up the training with the most promising methods. To overcome the limitation of training data size in the GP framework, we section the whole grid and train each section separately. 
%
An off-grid stellar model dataset is then used to test GP predictions. We find no obvious systematic offsets for all five outputs. The median testing error is $\sim$2K for effective temperature, $\sim 0.001$dex for surface gravity, $\sim$ 0.002$\rm R_{\odot}$ for radius, $\sim 0.001$dex for surface metallicity, and $\sim$0.02Gyr for stellar age. However, we find that local systematic uncertainty is not uniform across the parameter space and it mainly varies with mass, equivalent evolutionary phase, and initial metallicity. We hence train another GP model to describe the systematic uncertainties.      
%
We lastly use 100 fake stars to validate the accuracy of GP for modelling stars. GP-determined masses and ages are well consistent with true values within one standard deviation. We also note that GP models give sensible statistical sampling which overcomes the under-sampling issue in the grid-based modelling.
