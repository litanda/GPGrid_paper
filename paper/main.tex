% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Grid-based modelling is widely used for estimating stellar parameters. However, theoretical model grid is sparse.  This paper demonstrates an application of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which transfer a sparse model grid to a continuing function. We trained a GPR model with a model grid to learn the function from 5 independent fundamental inputs (Mass, fractional age, initial metallicity, initial helium fraction, and the mixing-length parameter) to 6 model outputs (age, seismic large separation, effective temperature, surface gravity, radius, and surface metallicity). The GPR function was then validated and the typical standard deviations of GPR predictions are 1\% for the age, 0.5$\mu$Hz for the seismic large separation, 12K for the effective temperature, 0.004dex for the surface gravity, 0.008$R_{\odot}$ for the radius, and 0.008dex for the surface metallicity. This indicates that GPR can be used to augmenting stellar grids and furthered model stars. We lastly applied the GPR function for modelling the Sun-as-a-star. The GPR function gives nicer statistical estimates than grid-based modelling does.
