\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

Discussions: advantages (GP give continuous functions, it is efficient (1 hour/model) , section scenario offers flexibility for large grid); limitations, .... future work: GP individual stars, MCMC etc. 

Conclusions: GP can be an accurate and efficient approach for augmenting stellar model grid.
