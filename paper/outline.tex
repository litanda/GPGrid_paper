\section{Outline}
This is a temporary section for the outline/to-do list. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[•] Framework of GP: model data augmentation with the established model grid
\item[•] Two strategies: S1 is from observables to fundamentals for modelling stars; S2 is from fundamentals to observables for augmenting model grids. \item[•] Step 1: selection of GP model inputs. Key points include independence of inputs and overlapping of the ranges of base data. 
\item[•] Step 2: selection of GP kernels and validation. 
\item[•] Step 3: uncertainty analysis. Key points include unreliable GP variance and the produce of uncertainty estimating.
\item[•] Step 4: Application of S1: 1) fake stars (MS, turn-off, subgiant) 2) real stars (the Sun, turn-off star, subgiant star) 3) solar calibration
\item[•] Step 5: Application of S2: augmenting the base grid (challenges, limitations due to grid step etc.)
\end{itemize}
